auction creation done,
item added done,
item updated done, 
number of user are also provided by seller which is also done,


Now need to create user class which will extend Thread
then need to create number of user provided by seller 
then take all the information of user 
then call user.start() method make bidding 
update currentBid after timer goes down we will get winnerðŸ˜Ž



User class :{
    whats more it can have ?
}

want to make a method in which we but then how can i call the star

Now what basic code is running 
and working fine 
--Just now some variables need to take its input from the table 
--Have to handle isActive variable 
--I think i need to make seller table 
--need to Make a file for all register user then (For io programming)
--Need to show Winner in bold and Use some Colors in the console 
--Then close the auction and make isActive to false after that , that auction can`t be restarted again
--Need to use some data structure to show all ongoing auction , by admin 
--Need to apply timer according to seller

Admin role
1. create auction (isActive initially true)
2.close auction (isActive to false) can`t be restarted again 
3.Can see all ongoing , stoped and all auctions 

Seller
1.add Item to the auction 
2.update item /Also gonna upadte its all property like price name etc 

User
  1. Can see How many auction are ongoing(See all auction)
  2.Apply to auction 



If needed i will make changes today as its already 1AM ðŸ˜­

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whats next 
--Need to handle the user Bit more 
--Fetch all data use data structure

Display Methods
--All auction can be displayed by Admin ongoing , and more
--Seller can also see All the Auctions 
--Still need to handle the isActive variable
--Id should be unique , foregin key ..
--User also can see ALl the auction 

Hence For all above three i can make a Special data Structure

IO programming for Current Bidds For Each auction Id bidd starts then new File for each auction with winner on the end
